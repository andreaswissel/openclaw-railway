# Sandboxing Guide

Sandboxing isolates agent execution in Docker containers, preventing compromised agents from accessing your system.

## Why Sandbox?

Without sandboxing, an agent can:
- Read/write any file the `openclaw` user can access
- Execute any command
- Access network resources
- Read your API keys and secrets

With sandboxing:
- Agent runs in isolated Docker container
- Limited filesystem access
- Network can be restricted
- Cannot access host system

## Enable Sandboxing

### Via CLI

```bash
openclaw configure --section sandbox
```

### Via Config

In `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "non-main",
        "workspaceAccess": "rw"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sandbox Modes

### `off` (Default)

No sandboxing. Agent runs directly on host.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "off"
  }
}
```

**Use when:** You trust the input source (e.g., only you use the bot).

### `non-main` (Recommended)

Sandbox channel sessions (Telegram, Discord) but not direct CLI usage.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "non-main"
  }
}
```

**Use when:** Multiple people use your bot via channels.

### `all`

Sandbox everything, including CLI sessions.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "all"
  }
}
```

**Use when:** Maximum isolation required.

## Workspace Access

Controls what files the sandboxed agent can access.

### `none`

Agent cannot access any workspace files.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "non-main",
    "workspaceAccess": "none"
  }
}
```

### `ro` (Read-Only)

Agent can read but not modify workspace files.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "non-main",
    "workspaceAccess": "ro"
  }
}
```

### `rw` (Read-Write)

Agent can read and write workspace files.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "non-main",
    "workspaceAccess": "rw"
  }
}
```

## Sandbox Scope

### `agent` Scope

Sandbox persists for the agent's lifetime. Shared workspace at:
```
~/.openclaw/agents/<id>/sandbox-workspace
```

### `session` Scope

New sandbox per conversation. Temporary directory cleaned up after session ends.

## Per-Channel Configuration

Different sandbox settings per channel:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "non-main",
        "workspaceAccess": "ro"
      }
    },
    "discord": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "all",
        "workspaceAccess": "none"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Railway: The Container IS Your Sandbox

On Railway, OpenClaw's Docker-based sandboxing won't work because Railway doesn't expose Docker to your container. But here's the thing: **the Railway container itself is already a sandbox**.

Your agent cannot:
- Escape the container
- Access Railway's host system
- Affect other Railway users
- Touch your local machine

What OpenClaw's sandboxing would add is isolating *each agent session* in its own throwaway container - useful if multiple untrusted users share your bot. For a personal bot, the Railway container boundary is sufficient.

**The security model for Railway:**

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| Railway container | Hard boundary - agent can't escape |
| Tool restrictions | Limits what agent can do inside |
| Pairing | Controls who can use the bot |

This is a reasonable security posture for personal use.

## Tool Restrictions (Railway's Alternative)

Instead of Docker sandboxing, this template uses two complementary mechanisms:

### 1. Tool Policy (openclaw.json)

Controls which tools the agent can use. Configured via `SECURITY_TIER` env var:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "tools": {
        "allow": ["read", "write", "edit", "memory_get", "memory_search", "web_search", "web_fetch", "exec", "cron"],
        "deny": ["process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Linux File Permissions (entrypoint.sh)

The entrypoint hardens file ownership after generating config. The agent's `read`/`write` tools respect OS file permissions:

| What's protected | How |
|-----------------|-----|
| `openclaw.json` (config) | `root:openclaw 640` — agent can read, **cannot write** |
| `.openclaw/` directories | `root:openclaw 750` — agent cannot create new files |
| `exec-approvals.json` | `root:openclaw 660` — gateway needs write for metadata updates |
| Non-essential env vars | Scrubbed from environment after config generation |

This blocks the critical privilege escalation where an agent overwrites `openclaw.json` to grant itself blocked tools (process, browser, nodes).

**Note:** OpenClaw's `tools.fs` blocklist config key is not supported by the gateway — it rejects it as unrecognized. File permissions are the enforcement mechanism on Railway.

### Exec Allowlist (exec-approvals.json)

Controls which shell commands the agent can run, deployed as a separate file at `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`. See [TIERS.md](TIERS.md) for per-tier allowlists.

## Recommended Configuration

For Railway with channel access, the default Tier 0 configuration is recommended. It provides:

- Tool policy limiting available tools
- Exec restricted to `ls` only via allowlist
- Config files write-locked via Linux permissions
- Pairing required for non-owner users

See [TIERS.md](TIERS.md) for how to progressively unlock more capabilities.
